### Sumcoin done right

This is the Android port of the breadwallet iOS app, which can be found [here](https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet/).

##### A completely standalone Sumcoin wallet:

Unlike many other Sumcoin wallets, Slicewallet is a real standalone Sumcoin
client. There is no server to get hacked or go down, so you can always access
your money. Using
[SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients)
mode, breadwallet connects directly to the bitcoin network with the fast
performance you need on a mobile device.

##### The next step in wallet security:

Slicewallet is designed to protect you from malware, browser security holes,
*even physical theft*. With AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, and verified boot, SliceWallet represents a significant security advance over
web and desktop wallets.

##### Beautiful simplicity:

Simplicity is slicewallet's core design principle. A simple backup phrase is
all you need to restore your wallet on another device if yours is ever lost or
broken.  Because slicewallet is  
[deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki),
your balance and transaction history can be recovered from just your backup
phrase.

### Features:
